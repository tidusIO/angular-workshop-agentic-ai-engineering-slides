  ## Wait... Why a new editor?

  Before we created this workshop we tried various editors including GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Wave etc.
  With [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) we experienced the most reliable coding solution when it came to larger projects.
  Cursor has a deep integration with [Anthrophic](https://www.anthropic.com/)'s models Opus & Sonnet, which are especially trained for coding. 
  That's why, we finally decided to us Cursor.

  ## Download and install Cursor

  - [Download Cursor](https://cursor.com/)

  ## What about costs?

  - Getting started with Cursor is free of charge.
  - After a short while, you'll reach a usage limit and be prompted to create an account.
  - Once you sign up, you'll receive a 2-week trial of Cursor Pro (no credit card required).
  - If you exceed the free allowance during our session, we'll provide you with an API key ‚Äî meaning workshops.de
   will pick up the tab. üôÇ

  ## What if I use GitHub Copilot
  > This section is based on observations during past workshops and is a subject to change. Development in the field of AI is quick.

  - Currently (14th of September 2025) Cursor seems to deliver more reliable results that GitHub Copilot. This is not only a matter of the used models (LLMs) but how the IDE is capable of interacting with them
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è If you use GitHub Copilot within a Company please make sure that MCPs are allowed and that you can use premium models, too.
