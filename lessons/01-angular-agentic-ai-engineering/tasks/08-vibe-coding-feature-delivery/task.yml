  ## The flow

  - For the next three features we add to our app follow the process we practised before:
    - draft a prompt and ask Cursor to come up with a refined prompt
    - instruct Cursor it shall ask for more information if it does not "feel" confident to implement the requirement
    - use the prompt and let the Agent develop the feature
    - review the changes in the code and in the browser

  ## Features

  - Add pagination to the book list
  - Allow crating a new book
  - Add a kanban board to track which books you have read (use the local storage for persistence) ðŸš€
    - The kanban board shall use drag&drop using the @angular/cdk

# Hints

  - Instruct Cursor to work on a separate branch if you like to keep the current branch clean

# Git Integration
git_tag_completed: "solution--feel-the-vibe"
